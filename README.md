# 🚀 60 Projects in 120 Days

Hey there! 👋

I didn’t land an internship this summer — so instead of sitting around, I’m building **60 projects in 120 days**.

That’s one project every two days.  
Big? Small? Weird? Experimental? Doesn’t matter — the goal is to **ship, learn, and have fun**.

## 🌟 What’s inside?

This repo will fill up with all kinds of random, cool stuff:
- 🕹️ Tiny games & visual experiments
- 💻 Algorithms & coding challenges
- 📱 Web apps & interactive tools
- 🤖 AI & generative art
- ⚙️ Whatever else I feel like working on

Check out the folders — each one is a standalone project.

## 💥 Why am I doing this?

- Build muscle → **code fast, code often**
- Learn new tools, libraries, and ideas
- Have something fun to show at the end of summer
- Prove you don’t need a fancy internship to level up

## ⚡ How you can follow along

- Watch this repo ⭐
- Browse the projects as they drop
- Steal ideas (seriously, go for it)
- Open issues or PRs if you want to play along

## 🚀 Let’s go

Day 1 → Project 1 → Done.
