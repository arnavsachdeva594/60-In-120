A Python project that generates random Sokoban puzzles and solves them using an advanced A search algorithm* with optimal heuristics and deadlock detection.

‚ú® Features
‚úÖ Random Level Generation
Automatically creates random Sokoban puzzles with customizable grid size and number of boxes.

‚úÖ Generate-Until-Solvable
Keeps generating random levels until it finds a solvable one.

‚úÖ Advanced Solver
Uses A* search with:

Hungarian Algorithm for optimal box-goal assignment

Deadlock detection (corner and edge deadlocks)

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Solution Animation
Visualizes the solution step-by-step directly in the console.

‚úÖ User Input
Choose grid size and number of boxes at runtime.

üìù Requirements
Python 3.7+

NumPy

SciPy

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy scipy
üì¶ Usage
Clone or download this repository.

Navigate to the project folder.

Run the main program:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Follow the prompts:

scss
Copy
Edit
Enter grid width (5‚Äì10):
Enter grid height (5‚Äì10):
Enter number of boxes/goals (auto-limited by grid size):
The program will:

‚úÖ Generate random levels until it finds a solvable puzzle
‚úÖ Display the generated level
‚úÖ Solve the puzzle and show the solution
‚úÖ Animate the solution step-by-step in the console

üéÆ Example Run

Sokoban AI Solver (Generate-Until-Solvable)

Enter grid width (min 5, max 10): 7
Enter grid height (min 5, max 10): 7
Enter number of boxes/goals (min 1, max 6): 2

Solvable level found after 3 attempt(s) in 0.14 seconds.

Generated Solvable Level:

#######
#.$@$.#
#######

Initial State:

Solution found in 4 moves:
Right -> Down -> Left -> Up

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
For larger grids or more boxes, generation and solving may take longer.

The solver is optimized for small to medium puzzles.

Want to use a different level generator (e.g., backward generation)?
‚Üí Simply replace the generate_random_level function in random_level.py with your own.
