      <h2>What is Conway’s Game of Life?</h2>
      <p>
        Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It’s a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

      <h3>How it works:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The "game" consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead.</li>
        <li>Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.</li>
        <li>At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).</li>
          <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why is it interesting?</h3>
      <p>
        Despite its simple rules, the Game of Life can produce incredibly complex patterns, including oscillators, spaceships, and even patterns that simulate computation. It’s a classic example of how complexity can emerge from simplicity.
