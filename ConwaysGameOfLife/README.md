## Overview

Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a mesmerizing cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game: you set the initial state, and the simulation evolves on its own according to simple rules, creating surprisingly complex and beautiful patterns[8][4].

This project is a modern, interactive, and visually polished web implementation of the Game of Life. The interface is fully responsive, dark-themed by default, and features intuitive controls for starting, pausing, stepping, resetting, randomizing, and adjusting the speed of the simulation.

## Rules of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

The universe is a two-dimensional grid of cells. Each cell is either **alive** or **dead**. At each tick (generation), the following rules are applied to every cell simultaneously[8][4]:

- **Underpopulation:** Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
- **Survival:** Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on.
- **Overpopulation:** Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
- **Reproduction:** Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.
